content_title: Roxe Overview
---

Roxe is the next-generation blockchain platform for creating and deploying smart contracts and distributed applications. Roxe comes with a number of programs. The primary ones included in Roxe are the following:

* [Nodroxe](01_nodroxe/index.md) (node + roxe = nodroxe)  - core service daemon that runs a node for block production, API endpoints, or local development.
* [Clroxe](02_clroxe/index.md) (cli + roxe = clroxe) - command line interface to interact with the blockchain (via `nodroxe`) and manage wallets (via `kroxed`).
* [Kroxed](03_kroxed/index.md) (key + roxe = kroxed) - component that manages Roxe keys in wallets and provides a secure enclave for digital signing.

The basic relationship between these components is illustrated in the diagram below.

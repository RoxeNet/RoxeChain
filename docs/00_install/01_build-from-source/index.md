content_title: Build ROXE from Source

[[info | Building ROXE is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to ROXE, it is recommended that you install the [ROXE Prebuilt Binaries](../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.

ROXE can be built on several platforms using different build methods. Advanced users may opt to build ROXE using our shell scripts. Node operators or block producers who wish to deploy a public node, may prefer our manual build instructions.

* [Shell Scripts](01_shell-scripts/index.md) - Suitable for the majority of developers, these scripts build on Mac OS and many flavors of Linux.
* [Manual Build](02_manual-build/index.md) - Suitable for those platforms that may be hostile to the shell scripts or for operators who need more control over their builds.

[[info | ROXE Installation Recommended]]
| After building ROXE successfully, it is highly recommended to install the ROXE binaries from their default build directory. This copies the ROXE binaries to a central location, such as `/usr/local/bin`, or `~/roxe/x.y/bin`, where `x.y` is the ROXE release version.

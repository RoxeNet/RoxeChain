content_title: Uninstall Roxe
---

If you have previously built ROXE from source and now wish to install the prebuilt binaries, or to build from source again, it is recommended to run the `roxe_uninstall.sh` script within the `RoxeChain/scripts` folder:

```sh
cd ~/roxe/RoxeChain
sudo ./scripts/roxe_uninstall.sh
```

[[info | Uninstall Dependencies]]
| The uninstall script will also prompt the user to uninstall Roxe dependencies. This is recommended if installing prebuilt Roxe binaries or building Roxe for the first time.

## Introduction

`clroxe` is a command line tool that interfaces with the REST API exposed by `nodroxe`. Developers can also use `clroxe` to deploy and test ROXE smart contracts.

## Installation

`clroxe` is distributed as part of the [ROXE software suite](https://github.com/ROXE/roxe/blob/master/README.md). To install `clroxe` just visit the [ROXE Software Installation](../00_install/index.md) section.

## Using Clroxe

To use `clroxe`, you need the end point (IP address and port number) of a running `nodroxe` instance. Also, the `nodroxe` instance must be configured to load the `roxe::chain_api_plugin` when launched. This allows `nodroxe` to respond to the RPC requests coming from `clroxe`.
